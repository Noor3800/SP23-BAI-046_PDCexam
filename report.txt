Best number of workers: 4
Explanation: With 4 workers, the CPU cores were efficiently utilized without extra overhead. Increasing beyond that (to 8 workers) added slight synchronization and process management delays, reducing overall performance.

Discussion:
Parallelism improved performance by dividing the workload across multiple cores, allowing simultaneous image processing. However, because the dataset is small and disk I/O (reading/writing images) dominates total time, the gains are modest. The distributed simulation demonstrated logical task division between nodes but showed similar performance due to co
